# Description
My program reads a schedule from a txt file, determines whether it is indeed a valid schedule, and then compares that with a user inputted schedule to detmerine if there are conflicting timelines.Now it can determine which schedule order will maximize the amount of courses that can be taken. 
# Challenges encountered
The toughest part of this milestone was creating the logic for the best_schedule function. The use of permutation had me very confused initially and clarification we heavily needed to set the logic for it. 

# Things I've learned
From this milestone I got a better understanding of how to allocate and de-allocate memory to avoid leaks. It did a good job at identifying my weak points before I go into the course final. The most important thing I learned this milestone was defintiely that memeber functions can call other member functions inside the class!
